A simple javascript based SPA application.

You could use `create-react-app` to create the app as well.

However, its quite simple to standup a simple SPA app using a bespoke configuration.
If you are integrating into an application there is a good chance that it
has been created over a long period of time, across many build and ui frameworks
so it could be messy.
