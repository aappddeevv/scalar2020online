"Full-stack" is a bit vague these days because of the blurring between front-end and back-end and the rise of front-end devices with significant compute and IO capabilities.

For any problem, there is a with the wide range of designs and architectures to choose from. A specific choice for your project may take into account factors such as:

- labor availability
- prior experiences on what works, i.e., proof-points
- deployment target
- audience
- time-to-market
- cost
- ...

Economic thinking is the typical way that these factors are combined to reach a decision. In this context, "economic thinking" really just means "business thinking." Business thinking can be unduly influenced by personal biases, but that's the way it works.

So, decisions are based on three factors:

- time-to-market (schedule)
- cost (both dollars and management attention)
- "good enough"

When it comes to any programming languge (PL), Personally, the specific PL is a small factor and it is often driven by other factors.

For example:

- Are there libraries/platform that solve my problem directly?
  - Can I ramp up quickly any unfamiliar tech?
- Can it scale enough for my target audience. Not everyone is a facebook or google. I do not want to over-engineer.
- Is there a large eco-system out there to tap into?
- Is it good enough to make money?

While you may personally find that scala-based solutions help solve problems faster and better, you do not always have a choice.

If you are tying into an existing project you will need to use technologies that fit into that project. You do not usually have the luxury of greenfield project and most people do not work in leading-edge problems-spaces that allow you to choose any technology.

## My Main Focus

My main technical focus is on smart powered decision making. So most of my time is spent
in AI/machine learning and complex data management. But I need capabilities that allow me to
deploy the decision making to the front-line and the front-line is usually composed of web applications like the kind discussed in this presentation.
