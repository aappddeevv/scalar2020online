- Using a simple platform like nodejs is an easy way to program.
  - Don't dismiss ergonomics when it comes to concurrency and parallelism.
  - Many javascript projects focus on ergonomics and the developer experience.
  - Many javascript libraries/frameworks are adopting elements of FP programming.
